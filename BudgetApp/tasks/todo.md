    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Categories for organizing expenses/savings/goals
categories (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('expense', 'savings', 'goal')),
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    color TEXT DEFAULT '#000000'
);

-- Expense tracking
expenses (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    category_id INTEGER REFERENCES categories(id),
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Savings tracking
savings (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    category_id INTEGER REFERENCES categories(id),
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Goals with targets and progress
goals (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    target_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    current_amount DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
    deadline DATE,
    category_id INTEGER REFERENCES categories(id),
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Data sharing between users
shared_data (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    owner_user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    shared_user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    data_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (data_type IN ('expense', 'savings', 'goal', 'category')),
    data_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    token TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    permissions TEXT DEFAULT 'read',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

## Development Principles
1. **Simplicity First**: Keep each change small and focused
2. **Modular Design**: Each component should be independent
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic features, add complexity gradually
4. **Security by Design**: Implement proper data isolation from the start
5. **User Experience**: Intuitive navigation and clear feedback
